            Despite efforts to prioritize natural energy sources and minimizing waste, global warming continues to escalate at a dangerous rate with global temperatures rising approximately 2°Fahrenheit in the last century. Although it may not seem like much, this problem has negatively affected all living beings on earth as further complications originating from global warming such as animal extinction, natural disasters, and rising sea levels have jeopardized our health and way of living. The reason global warming rates are escalating is because many people simply believe the problem does not affect them. Beyond global warming, people take advantage of the Earth’s resources (i.e. trees and oil) and in turn leave behind unimaginable amounts of waste. I believe that if more people understood the gravity of our planet's deteriorating state, we could enact change. The goal of this site is to serve as an educational tool, especially for younger generations, in order to provide a broad perspective on human effect on our planet ultimately engaging others in incorporating sustainability into their daily lives. Limiting our carbon footprint allows us to slow down the rate of global warming and give our planet a chance for a longer span of survival.

            <a id="GlobalWarming"> <h4>Global Warming and Climate Change</h4></a> 
            Although used interchangeably, global warming and climate change are not the same thing. Global warming is a subcategory of climate change and refers to the rapid increase in the temperature of the earth’s atmosphere whereas climate change refers to the long term changes occurring on our planet. Both are primarily caused by human efforts. Effects include:
            <ul>
                <li>Rising sea levels</li>
                <li>Ice loss at the Earth's poles</li>
                <li>Extreme weather changes including hurricanes, heat waves, droughts, floods</li>
                <li>Compromised agriculture</li>
                <li>Poor air and water quality</li>
                <li>Fewer water resources</li>
                <li>More disease/health issues</li>
                <li>Extinction of many species</li>
                <li>Biome changes</li>

            </ul>

            <a id="GreenhouseGasses"> <h4>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h4></a> 
            Greenhouse gasses are gasses prevent the heat generated by sunlight from leaving the Earth’s atmosphere. Two of the leading anthropogenic gases are carbon dioxide and methane. When these enter the atmosphere, they add to the previous greenhouse gases making the layer of gases thicker. These gases are vital because they trap enough ultraviolet rays in the atmosphere for the sun to warm the Earth, but when the layer of gasses gets thicker, it traps more heat than can escape. As a result of the extra gasses, the Earth’s temperatures are constantly increasing. Other greenhouse gasses include water vapor, ozone, nitrous oxide, and chlorofluorocarbons.

            <a id="CarbonDioxide"> <h4>Carbon Dioxide</h4></a>
            Human activities alone release over 30 billion tons of CO2 yearly making it the primary greenhouse gas emitted by people. Carbon Dioxide is released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil. In 2018, transportation accounted for nearly 34% of the US’s CO2 emissions as we have become dependent on fossil fuels to ship goods, fuel cars, trucks, planes, trains, and use other means of transportation.  Additionally, the combustion of coal in the generation of electricity for power has accounted for about 32% of CO2 emissions, producing more CO2 than natural gasses or oils. As the population grows and demand for electricity and travel increases, energy usage increases as well, further contributing to the growth in emissions.

            <a id="Methane"> <h4>Methane</h4></a>
            Although methane is second to carbon dioxide in greatest greenhouse gas emissions, CH4 is much more efficient at trapping heat making it worse for the Earth’s atmosphere. Most CH4 emissions come from agriculture; especially the meat industry. Livestock such as cows and goats consume grass and other plant matter which requires bacteria from the animal gut to digest this. But, since there is little oxygen in the gut, they produce methane as a by-product. Additionally, when the livestock’s manure is not aerated, it will also decompose into methane. Beyond agriculture, natural gas systems and waste decomposition are major contributors to CH4 emissions.

            <a id="Deforestation"> <h4>Deforestation</h4></a>
            With more farms and factories being created, deforestation rates increase in order to clear the land. Deforestation is particularly bad because it ruins the natural cycle of CO2 in our atmosphere. Without trees and other vegetation they are no longer able to perform their role in the carbon cycle in which plants take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and let out oxygen in an equal cycle. But when forests are destroyed the carbon dioxide is not absorbed in exchange for oxygen, leaving a higher concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. At the rate that we are cutting down trees, there won’t be enough trees left on Earth to produce oxygen and the excess carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere.

            <a id="Impact"> <h4>Your Impact</h4></a>
            There are many reasons people disregard the state of our planet. Some don’t think they can make a difference, some think it's too late for any change, some don’t care because they just don’t believe it, some don’t believe it's that big of a problem because not much has been done to solve it. Despite these false beliefs, there are many everyday actions that ordinary people, including you, can take that are environmentally friendly:
            <dl>
                <dt>Eat sustainably and cut back on meat and dairy intake</dt>
                <li> With supply comes demand and if we were to reduce our meat intake, there would be less livestock to produce methane. </li>
                <dt>Be mindful of your trash</dt>
                <li>As waste decomposes in landfills, methane is released. Therefore, when things can be recycled, recycle them! Landfills are overflowing with plastic and non reusable items.  We can reduce the amount of waste by reusing everyday items. These items include water bottles, snack containers, grocery bags</li>
                <dt>Minimize transportation</dt>
                <li>When traveling, make an effort to carpool, ride a bike, or take advantage of public transportation. It saves gas money and reduces fossil fuel consumption!</li>
                <dt>Reduce your energy use</dt>
                <li>Conserve energy and reduce CO2 emissions by turning off your lights and electronics when you aren’t using them. Once again, supply = demand and reducing your energy usage will reduce the emissions that stem from generating electricity </li>
                <dt>Take advntage of renewableenergy sources</dt>
                <li>Renewable energy sources include solar energy, wind energy, hydro energy, and others. If possible try to install solar panels for your own home! Not only does it reduce your demand for energy,  but it also saves money on your electricity bills in the long term. </li>
                <dt>Be mindful of water usage</dt>
                <li>As much as you may love long, hot showers, it takes large amounts of energy to clean and heat that water. Take shorter showers and make sure to turn off the sink while you brush your teeth. </li>
                <dt>Reduce your paper usage</dt>
                <li>About 40% of commercially cut timber is used for paper products which contributes to deforestation. In a world of technology, it’s easier to do school work without paper, however you should also be mindful of using paper towels, wrapping paper, and other daily paper products. </li>
                <dt>Speak</dt>
                <li>Speaking up encourages others to share a passion for caring about our planet. Encourage others to likewise make decisions that are better for the environment. </li>
                <dt>Vote</dt>
                <li>If you are of age, use your voice and vote for political candidates who prioritize our planet. Let those in positions of power know that you want change  </li>
